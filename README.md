### About

This project came about in November 2020, a month after the unveiling of the new vACC. The motivation behind the rewrite of the website is two-fold:
- New requirements & workflows with the new vACC, and therefore a better overview of the expectations of our web platform
- Need for newer, reactive & dynamic technologies to power our platform, notably with the use of VueJS and the full separation of frontend / backend

### Dependencies

This project's dependencies can be found in the `package.json` root file. It is based on the VueJS frontend framework, and uses the following dependencies:
- VueJS
- Vue-router
- Vuex
- Vuetify
- i18n
